## Set 
Sets are used to store multiple data iteams. Sets are unchangeable. Sets cannot allow multiple data items in a single variable. Sets are represent by curly braces {}.
## Get the Length of a Set
If we want to know that how many items are present in a variable we can use the length function of a set.
## Set Items - Data Types
Set items contain different data types. These may b int float string or boleans.
## The set() Constructor
The use of two round brackets for making a set is known as set constructor.
## Access Items
We cannot access to items by referring to an index but we can access to the set items using a for loop.
## Add Items
If a set is created we cannot change items in it but we can add new items in a set.
## Add Sets
Adding of new items from another set into the current set is known as update method.
## Add Any Iterable
We can add any iterable in a set. These iterables are tuple, dictionary and lists.
## Remove Item
For removing any item in the data set discard or delete method is used.
## POP method
If we want to remove last item for the data set we can used pop method.
## Clear method or del keyword
Cleae method is used to empties the whole set and the del keyword is used to delete the set completely.
## Join Two Sets
Two or more methods are used to join two sets. One is union method it returns the new sets that contains all items from both sets and the other one is update method which that inserts all items from one set to another set.
## intersection_update method
Intersection update method keep only that items that are present in both sets.
## symmetric_difference_update
Symmetric update method keep only that elements which are not present in both sets.
## symmetric_difference
Symmetric difference  method gave a new set that contains all the items from both sets except items that are present in both.
## Dictionary
Dictionaries are used to store multipe keys and values in a list. A dictionaries are unchangeable and do not allow multiple values in a list.
## Elif statment
We use this statement when if or else statement is not used. Then we try this statement.
